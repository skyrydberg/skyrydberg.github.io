I'm starting Zed Shaw's *Learn Python the Hard Way* today. I have a background in C/C++ programming, as well as a working 
knowledge of Java, C#, VBA and Matlab. I'm mostly doing this as a fun exercise to teach myself the basics of Python.

My code repo is here: [https://github.com/skyrydberg/LPTHW](https://github.com/skyrydberg/LPTHW)

If you'd like to see the lessons my code is derived from you can find them [here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

I will also be posting info about how I set up the github environment.

A couple things worth noting right off the bat:
1. It's called "Learn Python the Hard Way", Zed addresses this in his preface: "The title says it's the hard way to learn 
to write code but it's actually not. It's only the "hard" way because it uses a technique called instruction."
2. Since this is meant as an instructional post I will do my best to follow each step Zed presents, even if it's tedious, 
because in some way thats the point, we learn through repetition and coding is no different in that regard.
3. Read the section titled "The Hard Way Is Easier", it establishes ground rules and highlights the things Zed is aiming 
for his readers to get out of his work.

Finally, I know that *Learn Python the Hard Way* is free online, heck I've linked it from this page, but guys like Zed 
can only produce wonderful content like this if people support their work so please consider buying a copy, it's available
on [his site](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) as well as on:

[Amazon](http://bit.ly/amznlpthw) 

[Barnes & Noble](http://bit.ly/bnlpthw)
