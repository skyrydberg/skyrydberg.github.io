I'm starting Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way today. I have a background in C/C++ programming, as well as a working knowledge of Java, C#, VBA and Matlab. I'm mostly doing this as a fun exercise to teach myself the basics of Python.

If you'd like to see the lessons my code is derived from you can find it [here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

I will also be posting info about how I set up the github environment.
